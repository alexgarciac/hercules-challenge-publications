# hercules-challenge-publications
Code related to the Researchers and Publications track from the Hercules challenge.

## Directory layout

## Dependencies
In order to run the code from this repository, Python 3.7 or greater is required. Experiments were executed in Python 3.7.8, and that is the preferred version for the execution of the models. 

## Exploring the creation of the systems

## How to run the systems
> __Note__: In order to run the systems you must first obtain the models used to perform the topic extraction. Due to size constraints, they are not included in this repositories. There are two main alternatives to obtain the models: the first one is the execution of every notebook to retrain and build the systems for scratch, but this may take some time; the second alternative is to go to the [complete_system directory]() and follow the instructions to download the trained models.
Several scripts are provided in the _scripts_ folder to execute the systems and reproduce the results obtained for this track. In the following sections we will explain how to explain the main functionality of each script and how it can be executed.

### Obtain track results

### Predict publication topics

### Obtain author topics
