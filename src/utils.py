def get_topic_terms_by_relevance(model, vectorizer, dtm_tf, top_n, lambda_):
    """ Get the term distribution of a topic based on relevance.

    This method uses the relevance formula used by pyLDAvis to customize
    the relevance of the terms that will be returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        Sklearn topic modelling algorithm with a components_ field.
    vectorizer
        Sklearn vectorizer already trained.
    dtm_tf 
        Document term matrix of the initial training corpus returned by the vectorizer.
    top_n : int
        Number of top words to be returned for each topic.
    lambda_ : float
        Float in the range [0, 1] that will be used to compute the relevance of each
        term. A value equal to 1 will return the default terms assigned to each topic,
        while values closer to 0 will return terms which are more specific.
    
    Returns
    -------
    list of list of str
        2D array where the first dimension corresponds to each topic of the model, and
        the second one to the top n terms retrieved for each topic.
